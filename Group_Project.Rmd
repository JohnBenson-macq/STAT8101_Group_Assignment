### Abstract 

### Contents

### Introduction 

The Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2023 is a comprehensive survey that gathers valuable insights from a large and diverse population of software developers worldwide. The survey covers a wide array of topics, including developer roles, programming languages, tools, frameworks, job satisfaction, career aspirations, demographic characteristics and salaries. With a focus on capturing the evolving developer experience and understanding the impact of emerging technologies like AI/ML on developers' workflows, the survey offers a unique opportunity to investigate the determinants of developer compensation on a global scale.


#### Project Rationale

The tech industry is characterized by rapid advancements and constant change, making it imperative to understand the determinants of developer compensation. The factors that influence compensation have far-reaching implications, not only for individual developers' career trajectories but also for the overall productivity and innovation within organizations. It is therefore vital to study the interplay between the aforementioned factors in determining compensation.

#### Aim

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2023, focusing on understanding the factors that affect developer compensation across the world. We aim to use 'compensation' as the continuous response variable in our regression models to predict compensation based on various predictors such as geographic location, experience, technology used, and role in the industry. Additionally, we aim to investigate how AI/ML technologies are integrated into developers' work processes and consider their influence on job satisfaction and overall compensation. By analysing these, we plan to discover insights into the career paths of developers and the evolving technology landscape, providing valuable information for stakeholders in the tech industry. This analysis will highlight potential fields for the developer community and identify which variables are more influential.

### Data Description 

By collecting the voice of developers, the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2023 enables analysts, IT leaders, reporters and other developers to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies that are shaping the industry. The extensive reach and depth of information provided by the survey not only helps and provides context in understanding where trends in technology are heading, but also offers key attributes that can potentially influence developer compensation. Through a thorough analysis of this rich dataset, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between various variables, such as developer roles, skills, experience, and geographic location, that contribute to determining remuneration in the global tech industry.


The rows within this data set are representative of each respondent who filled out the survey and each column is representative of each question within the survey. As previously identified, there is a large number of missing values as respondents were unable to answer questions based on inability or branching of questions. These value have been dealt with xx as required by the objective xx. 


### Survey Methodology

#### Key Principles

- **Scope and Scale**: The survey reached 89,184 qualified software developers from 185 countries, indicating a broad global representation. The qualification for analysis was based on respondents' consent to share their data and completion of all required questions. About 2,000 responses were excluded due to incomplete data.

- **Duration and Timing**: The survey was conducted from May 8, 2023, to May 19, 2023. The median response time was nearly 18 minutes, which increased from the previous year due to the inclusion of additional questions this year.

#### Evaluation

- **Recruitment Methods**: Respondents were primarily recruited through Stack Overflow's own channels, such as onsite messaging, blog posts, emails, banner ads, and social media posts. This recruitment strategy likely led to a sample biased towards highly engaged users of Stack Overflow.

- **Geography**: Due to U.S. sanctions, the survey was not accessible in certain regions (Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria), potentially skewing geographical representation. Some respondents circumvented this using VPNs, which introduces another layer of bias in data representation.

- **Adaptive Questionnaire**: The survey employed conditional questioning, where certain topics (e.g., job-related questions) were only presented based on previous responses, which helps in reducing the respondent burden but could lead to biased results if not all relevant respondents see all questions.

- **Handling of Compensation Data**: Compensation data, which was optional, was provided by 48,026 respondents. Compensation were reported in local currencies and converted to USD using the exchange rate from June 2, 2023. High outlier Compensation were trimmed (less than 1% of data), suggesting robust handling of Compensation data to prevent skewing results.

- **Technological Inclusion**: Technologies to be included in the survey were selected based on previous years' data and community feedback. This participative approach helped ensure that the survey content remained relevant and reflective of current trends.

- **Randomization of Questions**: The survey randomized the order of blocks of questions to minimize the order effect, which can influence how questions are answered based on their sequence in the survey.

- **Data Analysis Adjustments**: Post-survey, several corrections were made to the online results, such as adjusting the Compensation filter to exclude small sample sizes and correcting display issues in sections about professional coders and AI tools. This demonstrates an ongoing commitment to accuracy and transparency in reporting survey results.

- **Non-response**: 
A variety of different forms of non-response occurs within this survey as a result of the questions composition, distribution methods and respondent locations. 
- Non-repossession based on branching or skip-logic: Many questions are skipped based on the respondents answers to previous questions. This is done to streamline the survey, improve the relevance of questions and increase the specif information gathered on respondents. For example, job focused questions would only be visible to those who responded that they had a job, therefore resulting in non-response for all branching questions.
- Non-response based on failure to respond when contacted: A number of participants that were emailed, failed to respond to the survey request despite repeated outreaches.
- The survey was conducted entirely in English resulting in the possibility of misinterpretation/misunderstanding of the questions asked. Given that the website operates wholly in English, however, the effect of language barrier non-response can be assumed to be minimal.
- The survey was conducted solely in English, which could lead to potential misinterpretations or misunderstandings of the questions. However, since the website operates exclusively in English, the impact of non-response due to language barriers is expected to be minimal.

The survey defined a non-response if either of the following criteria were met:
- Respondent failed to complete an emailed survey
- The respondent did not agree to the terms & conditions (Q120)
\newline
Non-response rates for The Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2023:
40,000 surveys were emailed out to Stack Overflow uses weighted by country and targeted on the most active users that had not already answered. Of these 27,414 were completed with 12,586 non-respondents, resulting in a non-response rate of 31.47%. The unanswered surveys were reissued, using oversampling methodologies to a new sample (n=18,240) that followed the same weighted criteria. Of the 18,240 survey that were reissued there were 3,834 respondents and 14,406 non-respondents resulting in a non-response rate of 78.98%. In total, the emailed survey received 31,248 responses against an initial sample size of 40,000 constituting a non-response rate of 21.88%. Combining the total number of emailed surveys i.e. initial sample + secondary sample = $40,000 + 18,240= 58,240$, however, a total non-response rate was calculated at 46.35% 

Methods to adjust for the non-response:
Targeted follow up strategies by way of follow-up communications were employed to encourage non-respondents to complete the survey.(Kelly et al., 2013) This included emailing and messaging the non-respondents. After a set time had elapsed, the number of non-respondents was redetermined along with aggregated statistic, specifically geographical location (country)(Corry et al., 2017). An additional round of emailed surveys targeting individuals with the same country characteristics as the non-respondents was conducted along with an oversampling strategy that had a sample size inversely proportional to the initial non-response rate.

### Data Analysis

**data description**
- of our data
The initial survey data consisted of 84 fields and 89,185 observations. The data collected broadly cover four main areas of interest: respondent characteristics, technology, AI and Stack Overflow metrics. The respondent characteristics
outlined details of the respondents including age, employment status, residing country, years coding and salary. The technology element encompassed data about the tools the respondents used as it pertains to programming including the programming languages they know and use, any databases they use, frameworks and platforms they may use and other tangentially related tools such as Confluence. The key topic for this year's developer survey centered around AI and, as such, several questions were asked as to the respondents use of AI and it's effect on their programming. Finally, data was collected around the respondents use of the Stack Overflow website including time spent on the site and what they used it for. Furthermore several questions were asked using a Likert scale to gauge respondents views on the design and usefulness of the site for their needs.

**Data Cleaning and manipulation**

To clean our data, we first began by subsampling the dataset to include only valid responses to *ConvertedCompYearly*. This decision was made as it maintains a large dataset (48,019 responses) while ensuring data integrity. Additionally due to the highly skewed nature of the data, and *ConvertedCompYearly* being the variable of interest any self-imputation would have been unreliable.

In order to prepare the data for imputation and subsequent regression analyses, several variables required augmentation. The *LanguageHaveWorkedWith* and *DatabaseHaveWorkedWith* variables contained multiple responses per respondent, indicating every language or database they had worked with. These variables were separated and encoded, along with *EdLevel*, *DevType*, and *OrgSize*, to create binary columns representing each unique response.

To handle missing values, we employed Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). Five iterations were selected as it gave a balance between computational efficiency and convergence of the algorithm. For the encoded binary variables, the logistic regression method ('logreg') was utilized, for the numeric variable *YearsCode* was imputed using predictive mean matching ('pmm'), this method preserves the distributional properties of the original data (van Buuren, 2007).

The MICE algorithm operates by iteratively imputing missing values in each variable based on the observed values of other variables. By generating multiple imputed datasets, MICE accounts for the uncertainty associated with missing data, providing a more robust and reliable basis for subsequent statistical analyses.

#### summaries of results

#### sucesses


#### limitations
- this is not a fully randomised survey, the population itself is thsoe who use stack overflow
- on the topic of disclosing salary, people may not be comoftoable to share given the nature of who is requesting the survey. stack overflow has soem details relating to you like name, email
- only two rouds of sending out the survey
