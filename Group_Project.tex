\hypertarget{key-principles}{%
\paragraph{Key Principles}\label{key-principles}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Scope and Scale}: The survey reached 89,184 qualified software
  developers from 185 countries, indicating a broad global
  representation. The qualification for analysis was based on
  respondents' consent to share their data and completion of all
  required questions. About 2,000 responses were excluded due to
  incomplete data.
\item
  \textbf{Duration and Timing}: The survey was conducted from May 8,
  2023, to May 19, 2023. The median response time was nearly 18 minutes,
  which increased from the previous year due to the inclusion of
  additional questions this year.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evaluation}{%
\paragraph{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Recruitment Methods}: Respondents were primarily recruited
  through Stack Overflow's own channels, such as onsite messaging, blog
  posts, emails, banner ads, and social media posts. This recruitment
  strategy likely led to a sample biased towards highly engaged users of
  Stack Overflow.
\item
  \textbf{Geography}: Due to U.S. sanctions, the survey was not
  accessible in certain regions (Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
  Syria), potentially skewing geographical representation. Some
  respondents circumvented this using VPNs, which introduces another
  layer of bias in data representation.
\item
  \textbf{Adaptive Questionnaire}: The survey employed conditional
  questioning, where certain topics (e.g., job-related questions) were
  only presented based on previous responses, which helps in reducing
  the respondent burden but could lead to biased results if not all
  relevant respondents see all questions.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{adequate-explanation-of-methods}{%
\paragraph{Adequate Explanation of
Methods}\label{adequate-explanation-of-methods}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Handling of Compensation Data}: Compensation data, which was
  optional, was provided by 48,026 respondents. Compensation were
  reported in local currencies and converted to USD using the exchange
  rate from June 2, 2023. High outlier Compensation were trimmed (less
  than 1\% of data), suggesting robust handling of Compensation data to
  prevent skewing results.
\item
  \textbf{Technological Inclusion}: Technologies to be included in the
  survey were selected based on previous years' data and community
  feedback. This participative approach helped ensure that the survey
  content remained relevant and reflective of current trends.
\item
  \textbf{Randomization of Questions}: The survey randomized the order
  of blocks of questions to minimize the order effect, which can
  influence how questions are answered based on their sequence in the
  survey.
\item
  \textbf{Data Analysis Adjustments}: Post-survey, several corrections
  were made to the online results, such as adjusting the Compensation
  filter to exclude small sample sizes and correcting display issues in
  sections about professional coders and AI tools. This demonstrates an
  ongoing commitment to accuracy and transparency in reporting survey
  results.
\end{itemize}
